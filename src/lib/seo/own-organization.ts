/**
 * Pages whose approved schema spec is the page's COMPLETE structured data, so
 * the marketing layout emits nothing site-wide for them — neither its
 * Organization nor its WebSite (see `SiteGraph`).
 *
 * Each page listed here carries exactly the spec's four blocks — Organization,
 * Service, WebPage, FAQPage (24–29 Sep requests):
 *
 *   /agentic-ai-development-services
 *   /custom-ai-development-services
 *   /generative-ai-development-company
 *   /rag-development-services
 *
 * so each page must also:
 *   - emit the spec's Organization itself (`softSuaveOrganizationLd`, which
 *     lists no Facebook profile — the site-wide node does);
 *   - turn off the footer's PostalAddress microdata
 *     (`<Footer addressMicrodata={false} />`).
 * Their WebPages carry no `isPartOf`, so nothing on them points at the WebSite.
 *
 * Kept free of `server-only` so the client `SiteGraph` can read it.
